# BlBoard

## A primitive black board to draw rectangles, circles, and add some text

blBoard is a lightweight digital whiteboard application built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw freely on a blank canvas, select colors, and adjust brush size, all within a simple, minimalist interface.

## Features
- Draw freely: Use the mouse to create lines and shapes.
- Color Palette: Choose from a set of vibrant colors, including grey, green, mustard yellow, and orange.
- Brush Size: Adjust the line thickness for different drawing effects.
- Simple UI: Minimalist design focused on ease of use.

## Tech Stack
I kept this minimal, using only basic HTML/CSS/JS.

## Installation
- Clone the repository or download the project.
- Open index.html in your web browser to start using the app.

This was done as a simple personal tool over few hours and not intended to be a professional tool or planned for further development. Feel free to use it as you wish!
